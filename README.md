# Multiple Choice Quiz

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a timed multiple choice quiz. The quiz is started by clicking the Start button at the top, which triggers a timer to start counting down. 

A wrong aswer will deduct 15 seconds from the timer, and the quiz is over when all the questions are answered, or the timer runs out and the display shows 'Game Over!' Upon answering the question, the user will be notified at the bottom whether or not their answer was correct or wrong. 

When the quiz is over the score is displayed, as well as a form to submit initials to log your score to local storage, which can be displayed and tracked for all previous rounds.
